/**
 * Controlled colour adaptation for a cloned template.
 *
 * The requirement is narrow and deliberate: the page must stay recognisably the
 * template while the branding moves to the book. So this changes ONE thing —
 * the accent — and takes only the HUE from the book's cover. Lightness and
 * saturation stay the template's.
 *
 * That constraint is what makes it safe. A navy-covered book on a warm-orange
 * template gets a navy CTA at the template's own lightness and saturation, not
 * a dark navy page. Backgrounds, section grounds, text colours, borders and the
 * template's light/dark polarity are never written to, so they cannot drift.
 *
 * The previous pipeline derived an entire palette from a single histogram bin
 * of the cover and applied it to everything, which is how a page copied from a
 * dark template came back light — the largest single "this doesn't look like
 * the template" defect, and one this function cannot produce.
