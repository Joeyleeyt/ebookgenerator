 *
 * What replaces it is verification that the clone is faithful and that the
 * commercially dangerous parts are ours. Both of the checks that matter most —
 * "does every buy button point at the seller's checkout" and "did the template's
 * buy buttons all survive" — had no equivalent in v1 at all.
