      'Write flowing, narrative prose that reads like a published book by an experienced practitioner — ' +
      'NOT a transcript summary, NOT lecture notes, NOT a bulleted outline, NOT a technical manual or SOP. ' +
      'Do NOT repeat the chapter title or number (the book renders those). ' +
      'Do NOT open with a subtitle, tagline, epigraph, or any heading — begin immediately with the opening-hook prose. ' +
      'Assume the reader has read the previous chapters: build on them and refer back naturally where it helps. ' +
      'Do NOT end with a "summary", "recap", "key takeaways", or "in this chapter" section.\n\n' +
      'THREE HARD FRAMING RULES:\n' +
      '(a) NO IN-CHAPTER PREVIEW: never tell the reader what this chapter will cover. Do not write "in this chapter ' +
      'you will learn…", "by the end of this chapter…", "here is what we will cover", or any list of the points ahead. ' +
      'Just deliver the content directly.\n' +
      '(b) NO BOOK STRUCTURE / LENGTH REFERENCES: never refer to the book\'s pages, length, or navigation. Do NOT write ' +
      '"as we shall see in the pages ahead", "in the next chapter", "earlier in this book", "a few pages/chapters ago", ' +
      'or mention page counts or how long/short the book is. You MAY recall an idea already taught, but as a concept, ' +
      'not as a page or chapter location.\n' +
      '(c) FRESH LANGUAGE — NO STOCK CRUTCHES: do not lean on formulaic filler that would repeat across chapters. ' +
      'Specifically avoid phrases like "As we shall see", "Numerous case histories have shown me", "In my (own) ' +
      'experience", "Time and again", "Make no mistake". Vary your transitions so no phrasing pattern recurs.\n\n' +
      'Move through this structure as a SEAMLESS narrative — do NOT print these labels:\n' +
      '1. Opening hook — a strong statement, surprising fact, bold claim, or vivid moment that creates curiosity.\n' +
      '2. A paradox or contradiction — an unexpected truth that challenges what most people assume.\n' +
      '3. Explanation — the clear, logical reasoning behind that paradox.\n' +
      '4. Three concrete case studies / real examples. Tell each as a short story that moves through the ' +
      'situation, the problem, the action taken, the result, and the lesson learned (narrated, not listed).\n' +
      '5. Objection handling — fairly raise and then resolve the one or two objections a skeptical reader would have.\n' +
      '6. The core principle — state the central insight plainly and memorably (e.g. "The real lesson is…" / ' +
      '"The key insight is…"). Put this single sentence in **bold** so it stands out.\n' +
      '7. Practical application — show the reader how to act on the idea, woven ENTIRELY into the prose as narrative ' +
      'guidance. Do NOT turn it into a numbered or bulleted procedure.\n' +
      '8. A forward transition — a brief closing that creates momentum toward the next idea WITHOUT summarizing this ' +
      'chapter and WITHOUT promising what specific later chapters or pages will contain.\n\n' +
      'NARRATIVE RULE: always prefer Story → Observation → Explanation → Principle → Action. ' +
      'Never write Fact → Fact → Fact. Use examples, analogies, and smooth transitions.\n' +
      'STYLE BAN: never write like a technical manual, SOP, or troubleshooting procedure. NEVER convert instructions ' +
      'into a numbered or bulleted list of steps (e.g. "1. Read the code. 2. Inspect the part. 3. Test the fluid…"). ' +
      'Any procedure must be told as flowing prose. Avoid jargon and acronym dumps.\n' +
      'FORMATTING — STRICT: output continuous flowing prose ONLY. Do NOT use ANY subheadings (no "#", "##", "###" — ' +
      'these read as unwanted chapter subtitles). Do NOT use ANY bulleted or numbered lists. The ONLY allowed markup ' +
      'is plain paragraphs, occasional *emphasis*, and the single **bold** core-principle sentence. It must read like ' +
