/**
 * Labels which nodes on an already-cloned page hold product content.
 *
 * This is the ONLY call in the pipeline that looks at the template, and it
 * cannot change it. The model is given an outline — node ids, tags, positions,
 * text — and returns a list of `{nodeId, placeholder}`. It never sees markup and
 * never emits markup, so a hallucinated id resolves to nothing and a malformed
 * response fails schema validation. Neither can affect the page.
 *
 * That is the structural difference from `LandingLayoutPrompt`, which this
 * replaces. That prompt spent 470 lines trying to talk a model into reproducing
 * a design it was simultaneously being given a competing spec for. Nothing here
 * needs saying twice, because the design is not up for discussion — it already
 * exists in the DOM this call is describing.
