/**
 * Looks at the layout we just built and says whether it is visually broken.
 *
 * The page contract checks everything mechanical — placeholders present,
 * sections marked, tags balanced, colours from the palette, slots declared and
 * placed. A layout can satisfy all of it and still be unusable: a portrait
 * rendered over the sticky header, a bullet list squeezed into twelve-character
 * columns, a third of a section left empty beside an image. Each of those
 * shipped to the client, and none of them is visible in markup — only once
 * painted.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. This is a defect check, not a design critique: it is
 * looking for things a person would call broken, because a reviewer that
 * complains about taste would reject good layouts and burn the repair rounds
 * that real faults need.
