 * A reference site's actual typeface, inlined so our page can use it.

 * webfont can only be used if its bytes travel inside the document. That is
 * what this produces: `@font-face` rules whose `src` is a `data:` URI.
 *
 * LICENSING IS THE CONSTRAINT, not the mechanism. Inlining a font file
 * redistributes it, which open licences (OFL, Apache) permit and commercial
 * desktop/web licences generally do not. Implementations MUST therefore embed
 * only from origins that exclusively serve openly-licensed fonts, and refuse
 * everything else — a self-hosted font on the reference's own domain is
 * exactly the case we cannot safely copy.
