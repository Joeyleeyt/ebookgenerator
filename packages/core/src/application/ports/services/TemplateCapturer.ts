/**
 * Renders a template site in a real browser and returns everything needed to
 * reproduce it — its DOM, its stylesheets, its assets, and measurements of what
 * it looks like.
 *
 * This replaces both `ReferencePageFetcher` (which used plain `fetch` and so saw
 * an empty app shell on any client-rendered site) and `ReferenceScreenshotter`.
 * The two produced descriptions of DIFFERENT documents — one the server HTML,
 * one the painted page — and the model was asked to reconcile them. Here one
 * browser session produces all of it, so the DOM, the CSS and the screenshots
 * are the same page by construction.
 *
 * SECURITY: the URL comes from a user and this drives a real browser inside the
 * worker's network — the most capable SSRF sink in the system. Implementations
 * MUST refuse non-public addresses before navigating, on every hop.
