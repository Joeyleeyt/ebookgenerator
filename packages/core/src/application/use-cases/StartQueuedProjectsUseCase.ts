/**
 * Admission controller for the per-user concurrency cap.
 *
 * Users may submit any number of books; SubmitChannelUseCase parks the ones over
 * the cap in QUEUED. This use case is what un-parks them: call it whenever a
 * project reaches a terminal state (completed, failed, cancelled) and it starts
 * as many of that user's queued books as there are now-free slots, oldest first.
 *
 * Safe under concurrency: the QUEUED → INGESTING_CHANNEL transition goes through
 * `advanceStatusAtomic`, so if two callers race (a completion and a cancellation
 * landing together) exactly one wins per project and only the winner enqueues the
 * ingest job. Two racing callers can each fill a slot they both saw as free, so
 * the cap is a soft limit that may briefly be exceeded by one — the same
 * trade-off SubmitChannelUseCase makes, and much cheaper than a distributed lock.
